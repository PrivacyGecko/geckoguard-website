# Privacy Policy - Gecko Guard

*Last updated: August 31, 2024*

## Introduction

Gecko Guard ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension handles your data.

## Core Principle: We Don't Collect Your Data

**Gecko Guard is designed with privacy-first principles:**
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ No data collection or storage on our servers
- ✅ All processing happens locally on your device
- ✅ No user accounts or registration required

## What Data the Extension Accesses

### Local Processing Only
The extension accesses certain data to provide privacy protection:

- **Websites you visit** - To apply blocking rules and protections
- **Cookies on websites** - To categorize and manage them locally
- **Browser fingerprinting attempts** - To detect and block them
- **Network requests** - To block trackers and unwanted content

### Data Storage
All data is stored locally on your device:
- Privacy settings and preferences
- Statistics about blocked content
- Custom rules and whitelists
- No data is transmitted to our servers

## Permissions Explained

- **activeTab** - Read current tab URL to apply protections
- **declarativeNetRequest** - Block unwanted network requests
