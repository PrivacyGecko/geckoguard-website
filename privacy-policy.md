# Privacy Policy - Gecko Guard

*Last updated: November 12, 2024*

## Introduction

Gecko Guard ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension handles your data.

## Core Principle: We Don't Collect Your Data

**Gecko Guard is designed with privacy-first principles:**
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ No data collection or storage on our servers
- ✅ All processing happens locally on your device
- ✅ No user accounts or registration required

## What Data the Extension Accesses

### Local Processing Only
The extension accesses certain data to provide privacy protection:

- **Websites you visit** - To apply blocking rules and protections
- **Cookies on websites** - To categorize and manage them locally
- **Browser fingerprinting attempts** - To detect and block them
- **Network requests** - To block trackers and unwanted content

### Data Storage
All data is stored locally on your device:
- Privacy settings and preferences
- Statistics about blocked content
- Custom rules and whitelists
- No data is transmitted to our servers

## Permissions Explained

### Required Browser Permissions
- **activeTab** - Read current tab URL to apply protections
- **declarativeNetRequest** - Block unwanted network requests
- **storage** - Save your settings locally
- **scripting** - Inject privacy protection scripts

### Why We Need These Permissions
Each permission is essential for privacy protection and used exclusively for that purpose.

## Third-Party Services

### Current Implementation
- No third-party analytics or tracking services
- No external API calls for core functionality
- All features work completely offline
- No cloud services or remote data storage

### Future Considerations
If we add optional cloud features in the future:
- All cloud features will be opt-in only
- Encryption will protect any synchronized data
- You'll maintain full control over your data
- Transparency reports will document any data flow

## Your Control

### Settings Management
- All settings stored locally on your device
- Export/import your configuration
- Reset to defaults at any time
- Completely remove all data by uninstalling

### Transparency
- Open development process
- Regular security audits
- Community-driven feature requests

## Data Security

### Local Security
- Extension follows browser security best practices
- No remote code execution
- Secure local storage encryption
- Regular security updates

### No Data Breaches Possible
Since we don't collect or store your data, there's nothing to breach.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We will update this policy if our data practices change. Any updates will be posted here with a new "last updated" date.

## Open Source Commitment

As an open-source project:
- Our code is publicly auditable on GitHub
- Community can verify our privacy claims
- No hidden data collection mechanisms
- Regular security audits and transparency reports
