Each permission is essential for privacy protection:
- **activeTab**: Read current page to apply protections
- **declarativeNetRequest**: Block unwanted network requests  
- **storage**: Save your preferences locally
- **scripting**: Inject privacy protection code

### Is my data secure?
Yes. Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing to breach. All settings are stored locally on your device using browser security standards.
